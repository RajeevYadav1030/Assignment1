						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p class="paragraph">Hello, I,m Rajeev kumar yadav. I am going to explain about the code written in HTML  and CSS.</p><hr>
						<p class="paragraph">I am a s tudent on learning new things. I am very curious on learning various non-human languages. I recently joined NAMI College after knowing it teaches BSc. Computing and the tutors were too friendly. Our module lecturer Mr. Ankit sir (CSY1018) taught us basics of HTML, CSS from the beginning and now we are capable of building up the websites. Also, he taught us to push the codes to github and store the codes for future reference. Designing and making the website user-friendly using CSS was a effortless task as our tutor taught us straightforwardly without any consequences. </p><hr>
			
						<h2>Discussion</h2>
						<p class="paragraph">Discussion basically promotes student to express and think about their declaration, what they have heard or learned. In my case, learning web development have been the best experience ever in my learning world as this module encourages and teaches us to make various websites and webpages. It encourages us to make the sites user-friendly, make it responsive so that it can be seem fine on small as well as big screens. The website must be responsive across all devices so that there will be a fine experience on user interface. I also learned to detect the bugs and debug it efficiently. Learning was never been so easy and effective. I learned so many things within a very short period of time.

						<h2>Development</h2>
						<p class="paragraph"> I frequently changed the site's design and looks time to time to make it look more attractive but I failed several times and I decided to change the website's layout, designs and all.</p>
